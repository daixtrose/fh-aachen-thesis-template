The [`thesis.bpmn`](thesis.bpmn) file was generated using [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io/). You can download the offline tool [here](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/).

For other diagrams we recommend using [draw.io](https://diagrams.net/). You can download the latest release of the offline tool [here](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/).

For very elaborated diagrams you can directly use the [Pgf/Tikz](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en) LaTeX package. Find some examples [here](https://texample.net/tikz/examples/). A good tutorial can be found in the [Overleaf documentation](https://texample.net/tikz/examples/).
